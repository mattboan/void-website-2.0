### 1. Contrast

The way distinct elements, especially neighbouring elements, are arranged in a design is referred to as contrast. These variations highlight different elements and can play a significant role in designing readily available designs. Text content in particular can be extremely challenging to read when there is insufficient contrast, especially for those who are visually impaired.

Given that consumers' attention spans are getting shorter on average, you need to find a medium that will capture and hold their interest for extended periods of time. Consumers can explore and comprehend a design's depths by examining its opposing elements. A visually striking arrangement of contrasting colours and shapes can attract more viewers than a comparable setup lacking contrast.

### 2. Balance

Every design element and principle, such as font, colour, image, shape, pattern, etc., has a visual impact. While some elements are lighter, others stand out due to their weight. The arrangement of these components on a page ought to produce a sense of harmony.

Symmetrical and asymmetrical balance are the two main forms; in symmetrical designs, the layout elements have equal weight on both sides of an imaginary centre line. Different weights are used in asymmetrical balances, which are frequently arranged in relation to a line that is not at the centre of the overall design.

Design balance is crucial because it gives an image a more organised structure and helps communicate a message. The human eye finds it visually pleasing and reassuring because we prefer to see structure in the objects we see.

In addition to creating definite focal points throughout an image, designs that are balanced can also be helpful for advertising and storytelling. Without balance, a design may appear cluttered or confusing and fail to effectively communicate its intended message because there is no distinct focus area or rhythm.

### 3. Proportion

The elements' sizes in relation to one another are called proportions. To put it simply, proportion establishes what parts of a design are important and which are not. Smaller elements are less significant than larger ones. Changing the proportions of your design can affect how people interact with and react to it. You can frequently manipulate the responses of your audience by using appropriate proportional elements.

### 4. Hierarchy

The hierarchy of a website affects how easily users can process its content. It alludes to the significance of certain components inside a design. The best way to show hierarchy in a design is to use headings and titles.

Since the title page should be the most significant part of the page, it should be easily identifiable as such. Formatting headings and subheadings should demonstrate the importance of each element with regard to the title, body copy, and each other.

An individual is guided through the content by the visual hierarchy. They receive signals about which content is most important, how it is arranged into relevant sections or categories, and what content they should concentrate on.

### 5. Repetition

Repetition is a fantastic technique to reaffirm an idea and bring a design with many disparate elements together. The same colors, typefaces, shapes, or other design elements can be repeated in a variety of ways to achieve this. Repetition is a fantastic technique to give the work texture, life, and dimension. Additionally, repetition works wonders for drawing attention to particular parts of your content or supporting a point you want to make clear to your audience.

### 6. Rhythm

One can create five basic types of visual rhythm through design: random, regular, alternating, flowing, and progressive. A sense of rhythm can also arise from the spaces created between repeating elements. Various emotions can be evoked through rhythms; they can evoke excitement, comfort, and constancy. The manner in which it is executed determines everything. Effective rhythm can alter how a viewer interacts with a piece by guiding their gaze through it in a particular way.

### 7. White Space

The space inside a design that is devoid of any design elements is also known as "negative space” or white space. In essence, the area is vacant. The importance of white space is frequently overlooked by inexperienced designers who feel pressured to jam every pixel with some kind of "design." White space does, however, have another crucial function in design, primarily in providing elements with breathing room.

Using white space guarantees that design elements and empty spaces are distributed equally and in the right proportion. In addition to making a design more aesthetically pleasing, establishing balance and visual structure or order enhances the user experience and the cohesiveness of the whole.

### 8. Movement

Describes how the viewer's gaze moves across a design; as a result, the most significant element ought to lead to the next most significant one, and so on. This is achieved through emphasis, positioning—the process by which the viewer's gaze naturally focuses on particular parts of a design first—and other previously discussed design elements.

Motion is a great tool for cuing particular behaviors and actions. Due to innate brain tendencies, our eyes typically move in a relatively predictable manner when we read a composition. Linear paths, such as solid and dotted lines, are normally instinctively followed by the human eye. By using this tool, we can create much more dynamic and captivating images by controlling how our eyes move and how we navigate the layout of the page.

### 9. Variety

Variety can be produced in a number of ways using color, typography, images, shapes, and almost every other aspect of design to add visual interest. A design can easily become boring without variation, which makes the user disinterested. In order to produce a more engaging and visually appealing result that enhances the user's experience, variety should support and complement the other design components.

### 10. Unity

Describes how well a design's components function together. In a design, the relationships between the visual components should be evident. A coherent, clear communication of concepts is ensured by maintaining unity.

In my opinion, well-unified designs are more organized, authoritative, and of superior quality than disjointed ones. Consider unity to be an instantly identifiable branding. Businesses frequently use color to tie together every aspect of their brand, including their web page, storefront, and logo.

### Conclusion

We all know that artificial intelligence (AI) will take over the world because of its incredibly helpful design tools, which can simplify any task. However, what matters is how you use AI and adapt it to your own knowledge and skill set to produce amazing work.

You may not believe you have what it takes, but trust me when I say that AI cannot compare to the work that humans can accomplish when we adhere to what is fundamental!
